    "1. Data Question/Problem:\n",

    "- Example: \"Which products are performing best this quarter?\"\n",
    "- A well-defined problem guides the entire analysis and ensures focus.\n",

    "2. Data Collection:\n",
    "- Gather the data needed to answer the question (from databases, APIs, surveys, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Cleaning:\n",
    "- Remove duplicates\n",
    "- Handle missing values\n",
    "- Correct inconsistencies in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Transformation:\n",
    "- Format data for consistency.\n",
    "- Convert data into the right format or structure for analysis (e.g., normalization, **aggregation**).\n",
    "- Create new features or categories relevant to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Analysis:\n",
    "- Perform statistical or machine learning methods to explore patterns, relationships, and trends.\n",
    "- Methods vary depending on the **type of data** and **question**:\n",

    "| What are the patterns or trends in my data? | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)              | Use visualizations like bar charts or line plots to examine sales trends over time. |\n",
    "| Is there a relationship between variables?  | Correlation or Regression Analysis           | Analyze if there's a correlation between marketing spend and customer acquisition. |\n",
    "| How can I predict future outcomes?          | Predictive Modeling (Regression, Classification) | Build a regression model to predict future sales based on historical data. |\n",
    "| What groups or segments exist in my data?   | Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering) | Use K-means clustering to segment customers into different behavior groups. |\n",
    "| What factors are the most important?        | Feature Importance (Decision Trees, Random Forest) | Use a decision tree to identify which factors most influence customer churn. |\n",
