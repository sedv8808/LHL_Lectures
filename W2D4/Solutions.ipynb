    "- What are foreign key constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. In the Sakila database, this could include the `customer_id` in the **rental** table referring to the **customer** table or `film_id` in the **inventory** table referring to the **film** table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why are foreign keys important for data integrity?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Foreign keys** enforce referential integrity, ensuring that a record in one table cannot exist without a valid, related record in another table. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "A **rental record** cannot exist without a corresponding **customer**.\n",
    "A **rental** should not exist for a **film that doesnâ€™t exist** in the film table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What happens without referential integrity?\n",
    "  \n",
    "> Without enforcing foreign key constraints, data can become inconsistent.  \n",
    "For instance:  \n",
    "You could have rentals with no customer associated, which would make the data invalid or unusable.\n",
    "A film might be removed from the film table, but the corresponding records in the inventory or rental tables could remain, leading to orphaned records.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does enforcing referential integrity help?\n",
    "\n",
    "> It ensures data quality by preventing:\n",
    ">- Insertion of invalid data (e.g., a rental without an existing customer).\n",
    ">- Deletion of important data that still has dependent records (e.g., preventing the deletion of a customer who has active rentals).\n",
    ">- It maintains accuracy and reliability of the relationships in the database, ensuring that the data remains meaningful and trustworthy over time."
